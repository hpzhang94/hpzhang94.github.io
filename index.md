I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the information and computer sciences (ICS) department of <a href="https://www.ics.hawaii.edu/"><u>University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa</u></a>. 

#### I have multiple openings for self-motivated PhD students starting in Fall 2025, Spring 2026, and Fall 2026.


## Biography

Dr. Haopeng Zhang earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Davis, under the supervision of <a href="http://jiaweizhang.net/"><u>Dr. Jiawei Zhang</u></a>. He holds two M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering / Computational Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). His research interests include natural language processing (NLP), generative AI, and NLP for science.


## Research Interests:

- **NLP**: Summarization, generation, low-resource languages
- **Generative AI**: LLMs, vision-language models, multimodal foundation models
- **NLP4Science**: Cognitive science, healthcare
- **Graph Mining**: Graph4NLP
