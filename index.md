Haopeng Zhang is a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the <a href="https://www.ics.hawaii.edu/"><u>University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa</u></a>, where he directs the ALOHA (Advanced Language Processing and Human Analytics) Lab. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Davis, advised by <a href="http://jiaweizhang.net/"><u>Dr. Jiawei Zhang</u></a>. He also holds dual M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computational Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). His research focuses on NLP, LLM, and AI4science

## Research Interests
I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, especially focusing on
- **NLP**: Summarization, Generation, Low-Resource Languages
- **Generative AI**: LLMs, VLLMs, Multimodal Foundation Models
- **AI4Science**: Healthcare, Linguistics, Sensing, Nutrition
- **Graph Mining**: Graph4NLP
